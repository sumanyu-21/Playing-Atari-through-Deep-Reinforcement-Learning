The code has been divided into 3 parts. 
(i) The DeepQNetwork.py file contains the code for the DeepQNetwork Class. This class defines the neural network architecture
(ii) The Agent.py file contains the code for the Agent Class. This class defines the preprocessing of states and updating of the Deep Q Networks.
(iii) The main.py file contains the main loop for the program.
In order to run the code, just run the main.py file with Agent.py and DeepQNetwork.py files in the same directory as the main.py file.
